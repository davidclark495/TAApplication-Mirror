# Overview of the TA Application Functionality
    
    TAApplication has sign-in and register features, with users separated
into 3 roles, Spplicants, Professors, and Admins. Each user has one role, and will see
different pages/links based on that role. Both frontend and backend are independently secured
and validated.

    It allows Applicants to submit applications, which include academic and other data. Some fields are optional.
Applicants can upload resumes (.pdf) and images (.png, .jpg, .gif).
