# Overview of the TA Application Functionality
    
PS4:
    TAApplication has sign-in and register features, with users separated
    into 3 roles, Spplicants, Professors, and Admins. Each user has one role, and will see
    different pages/links based on that role. Both frontend and backend are independently secured
    and validated.

PS5:
    It allows Applicants to submit applications, which include academic and other data. Some fields are optional.
    Applicants can upload resumes (.pdf) and images (.png, .jpg, .gif).

PS6:
    New users can register and login with Google. The Admin can create and edit courses. The Admin and all professors can view 
    a list of available courses, with links to further details. Special notes on courses are seen/editted only by the Admin.
